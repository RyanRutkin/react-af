const FIELD_HELP_LONG_DETAILS: Record<string, string> = {
  "$id": "The <strong>$id</strong> keyword establishes the canonical URI for a schema resource, which becomes the base for relative references and nested identifiers. In draft 2020-12, stable and absolute identifiers make schema reuse, bundling, and external referencing significantly more predictable across tools.",
  "$schema": "The <strong>$schema</strong> keyword declares the dialect and meta-schema that define keyword behavior for this document. Declaring this explicitly helps validators select correct semantics and avoids ambiguity when multiple drafts are supported.",
  "$ref": "The <strong>$ref</strong> keyword replaces local constraints with the referenced schema target, enabling modular schema design and reuse. In 2020-12, references participate in dynamic resolution rules and should be treated as schema application rather than a textual include.",
  type: "The <strong>type</strong> keyword constrains instance types and is often the first line of validation structure for a field. In 2020-12, <strong>type</strong> can be a single value or an array of values to express unions, and other assertion keywords should align with the allowed types.",
  title: "The <strong>title</strong> keyword is an annotation intended for human-facing tools such as documentation and generated forms. While it does <strong>not</strong> influence pass/fail validation, it is important for readability and schema maintainability.",
  description: "The <strong>description</strong> keyword provides richer human guidance about expected data semantics and usage context. It is annotation-only, so it should be used to improve comprehension without being relied on for enforcement.",
  deprecated: "The <strong>deprecated</strong> keyword communicates that a field or value path is still accepted but should be phased out. This is particularly useful for compatibility windows and migration planning in APIs and event schemas.",
  readonly: "The <strong>readOnly</strong> keyword is an annotation that indicates values are intended to be supplied by producers and <strong>not</strong> edited by consumers. It is commonly interpreted by UI and API tooling even though it is <strong>not</strong> a direct validation assertion.",
  writeonly: "The <strong>writeOnly</strong> keyword is an annotation indicating values are intended for input but should <strong>not</strong> be returned in output contexts. It is often used for secrets, credentials, and transient request-only fields.",
  examples: "The <strong>examples</strong> keyword provides non-normative sample instances that help humans and tools understand expected values. These <strong>examples</strong> are documentation aids and are <strong>not</strong> <strong>required</strong> to be validated as constraints by implementations.",
  default: "The <strong>default</strong> keyword suggests a value that may be used when an instance omits the field. Because JSON Schema does <strong>not</strong> mandate <strong>default</strong> assignment behavior, producers should treat it as guidance rather than implicit mutation.",
  const: "The <strong>const</strong> keyword enforces exact deep-equality with one specific JSON value, including <strong>type</strong> and structure. It is useful when a discriminator or fixed contract token must always remain constant.",
  enum: "The <strong>enum</strong> keyword constrains the instance to one of a finite set of values compared by JSON deep-equality. This is ideal for controlled vocabularies and closed option sets across both primitive and structured values.",
  minlength: "The <strong>minLength</strong> keyword applies only to strings and sets a lower bound measured in Unicode code points. It should be paired thoughtfully with <strong>maxLength</strong> when defining bounded text fields.",
  maxlength: "The <strong>maxLength</strong> keyword applies only to strings and sets an upper bound measured in Unicode code points. This protects payload size and supports UI, storage, and transport constraints.",
  pattern: "The <strong>pattern</strong> keyword applies an ECMA-262 regular expression to string instances, succeeding when a match is found. Patterns are <strong>not</strong> implicitly anchored, so use explicit anchors when full-string matching is <strong>required</strong>.",
  format: "The <strong>format</strong> keyword conveys semantic expectations such as email, URI, hostname, or date-time. In 2020-12, <strong>format</strong> behavior depends on implementation configuration and may be annotation-only unless assertions are enabled.",
  minimum: "The <strong>minimum</strong> keyword sets an inclusive numeric lower bound and applies to number and integer instances. Use this when a boundary value itself is valid and should be accepted.",
  maximum: "The <strong>maximum</strong> keyword sets an inclusive numeric upper bound and applies to number and integer instances. Use this when the boundary value itself should remain valid.",
  multipleof: "The <strong>multipleOf</strong> keyword requires numeric values to divide evenly by a positive divisor. This is commonly used to enforce precision steps, measurement increments, and monetary granularity.",
  exclusiveminimum: "The <strong>exclusiveMinimum</strong> keyword defines a strict numeric boundary where values must be greater than the threshold. It is appropriate when an endpoint must be excluded from valid input.",
  exclusivemaximum: "The <strong>exclusiveMaximum</strong> keyword defines a strict numeric boundary where values must be less than the threshold. It is useful for open upper intervals and strict cap behavior.",
  properties: "The <strong>properties</strong> keyword maps specific object member names to subschemas that validate corresponding member values. It only applies when those named members are present and does <strong>not</strong> by itself require their presence.",
  required: "The <strong>required</strong> keyword lists object property names that must exist on an instance object. Presence is enforced independently from value constraints, which are validated by associated subschemas.",
  additionalproperties: "The <strong>additionalProperties</strong> keyword controls validation for object members <strong>not</strong> matched by <strong>properties</strong> or <strong>patternProperties</strong>. In strict object designs, setting this to false prevents unrecognized keys from passing.",
  unevaluatedproperties: "The <strong>unevaluatedProperties</strong> keyword applies after other applicators and targets object members that remain unevaluated. This makes it especially powerful with composition keywords when enforcing closed-world object shapes.",
  propertynames: "The <strong>propertyNames</strong> keyword validates each object key string against a subschema, independent of corresponding values. It is useful for naming conventions, prefix rules, and machine-generated key constraints.",
  minproperties: "The <strong>minProperties</strong> keyword sets the <strong>minimum</strong> count of key/value pairs <strong>required</strong> in an object instance. It supports cardinality rules independent from which exact <strong>properties</strong> are <strong>required</strong>.",
  maxproperties: "The <strong>maxProperties</strong> keyword sets the <strong>maximum</strong> count of key/value pairs permitted in an object instance. This can prevent over-populated objects and constrain dynamic key scenarios.",
  dependentrequired: "The <strong>dependentRequired</strong> keyword expresses conditional presence dependencies between object <strong>properties</strong>. When one property appears, a configured list of sibling <strong>properties</strong> must also be present.",
  dependentschemas: "The <strong>dependentSchemas</strong> keyword applies whole-object subschemas when specific trigger <strong>properties</strong> are present. It enables conditional object validation patterns that go beyond simple <strong>required</strong> lists.",
  patternproperties: "The <strong>patternProperties</strong> keyword assigns subschemas to regex-based key groups, allowing families of similarly named members to share validation rules. Multiple regexes may apply to the same property name.",
  items: "In draft 2020-12, <strong>items</strong> applies to array positions <strong>not</strong> covered by <strong>prefixItems</strong> and therefore governs trailing elements. This separates tuple-prefix constraints from the schema for remaining array entries.",
  prefixitems: "The <strong>prefixItems</strong> keyword defines positional schemas for tuple-like arrays where each index has a distinct rule. It is evaluated in order and is foundational for fixed-structure array contracts.",
  minitems: "The <strong>minItems</strong> keyword sets the <strong>minimum</strong> number of elements <strong>required</strong> in an array instance. It is commonly combined with <strong>contains</strong> or tuple rules to ensure baseline completeness.",
  maxitems: "The <strong>maxItems</strong> keyword sets the <strong>maximum</strong> number of elements permitted in an array instance. It is useful for preventing oversized arrays and bounding processing cost.",
  uniqueitems: "When <strong>uniqueItems</strong> is true, every pair of array elements must be unequal under deep JSON comparison. This enforces set-like semantics, including for objects and arrays.",
  contains: "The <strong>contains</strong> keyword requires array instances to include elements matching a given subschema. In 2020-12, it can be further quantified with <strong>minContains</strong> and <strong>maxContains</strong> to constrain match counts.",
  mincontains: "The <strong>minContains</strong> keyword defines the <strong>minimum</strong> number of elements that must satisfy the <strong>contains</strong> subschema. It is ignored when <strong>contains</strong> is absent and should be configured alongside <strong>contains</strong>.",
  maxcontains: "The <strong>maxContains</strong> keyword defines the <strong>maximum</strong> number of elements that may satisfy the <strong>contains</strong> subschema. It is ignored when <strong>contains</strong> is absent and helps bound matching frequency.",
  unevaluateditems: "The <strong>unevaluatedItems</strong> keyword applies to array elements <strong>not</strong> already evaluated by <strong>prefixItems</strong>, <strong>items</strong>, <strong>contains</strong>, or composed branches. It is valuable for enforcing tight post-composition array contracts.",
  allof: "The <strong>allOf</strong> keyword requires the instance to satisfy every subschema in the array, equivalent to logical conjunction. It is useful for composing orthogonal constraints into a single effective schema.",
  anyof: "The <strong>anyOf</strong> keyword requires at least one subschema to validate, equivalent to logical disjunction. It is suitable for permissive alternatives where overlaps are acceptable.",
  oneof: "The <strong>oneOf</strong> keyword requires exactly one subschema to validate, making it stricter than <strong>anyOf</strong>. It is commonly used for tagged union designs where alternatives should be mutually exclusive.",
  not: "The <strong>not</strong> keyword inverts validation for its subschema and passes only when the subschema fails. It is useful for exclusion constraints and disallowing problematic shapes.",
  if: "The <strong>if</strong> keyword defines a predicate subschema used to choose conditional branches. Its result controls whether <strong>then</strong> or <strong>else</strong> is evaluated when those keywords are present.",
  then: "The <strong>then</strong> keyword is applied only when <strong>if</strong> succeeds, allowing additional constraints in the true branch. It is often paired with discriminators and property dependencies.",
  else: "The <strong>else</strong> keyword is applied only when <strong>if</strong> fails, providing alternate constraints for the false branch. Together with <strong>if</strong>/<strong>then</strong>, it forms full conditional validation flow in a single schema node."
